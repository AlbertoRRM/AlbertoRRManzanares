Welcome to Pass the Calculator!

This is a very simple game so don't worry if you
have never played, we are going to explain you
how to start :)

1. Who starts?
The computer will decide randomly which player
is gonna start.

2. Who wins?
There is a counter called "SUM" and his value
is 0. Each time a player enter a number, SUM
it will be equal to the sum of the previous value
of SUM and the number introduced by the player.
		SUM = SUM + number

The player who exceed 31 will lost the game, so
decide carefully which number are you gonna press!

There is a rule to enter a valid number but we'll
see in the next point ;)

3. How to enter a valid number?
Let's suppose two players: A and B. A presses a
number key and then enter. Next turn is for B, who 
have to choose a different number in the same row 
or column as the one chosen by A.

7	8	9
4	5	6
1	2	3

It's simple, isn't?
Now you are ready to play, enjoy it! :D
